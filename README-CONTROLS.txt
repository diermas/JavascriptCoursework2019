Setting Up:
First run the TimeTableMaker.js file to set up the database, then run DungeonServer.js to start the server listening on localhost:8081.

How to Play:
Keyboard: Use WASD or the arrow keys to move.
Mouse: When you mouse over the game, four segments will appear. Each segment can be clicked in to move the character in that direction.
Touch: The same as mouse controls, when you tap in a segment the character will move.

I edited it to give it an identifying outline when it is the player controlled character.
